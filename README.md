To create a snake game in HTML5, we will need to use JavaScript for the game logic and CSS for styling. The game will consist of the following files:

1. `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that will contain the game canvas and link to the CSS and JavaScript files.
2. `style.css`: This is the CSS file that will contain the styles for the game.
3. `snake.js`: This is the JavaScript file that will contain the game logic.
4. `package.json`: This is the NodeJS package manager dependency definition file.

Let's start with the `index.html` file:
